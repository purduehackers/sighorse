# SIGHORSE

[SIGHORSE (the Special Interest Group in Horsing Around)][site] is a 8.7× better
journal than all the other journals out there. This summer, go on an adventure
(or many!), then create educational artifacts (blog post, video, poster, paper,
embroidered armor) about your adventure, and bask in glory forevermore.

This repo is somewhat internal in the sense that there hasn't been effort in making it make sense to an uninvolved onlooker.
